# 90_HISTORY_CONSOLIDATED

## Purpose
Preserve historical decisions, incidents, and remediation outcomes in one place without polluting active execution docs.

## When to Read
Read only for context on legacy decisions, prior incidents, or rationale behind retired constraints.

## Source of Truth
- Historical review and remediation records previously stored in archive markdown files.

## Last Updated
2026-02-23

## Owner
Core maintainers of `/Users/zhiyangcui/Documents/trae_projects/simple-cat-tool`

## Not Active Policy
This document is historical context only. It is not an active development policy source.

## Timeline Summary
### 2026-02-06
- Multiple Editor white-screen incidents were diagnosed and fixed (function ordering, index confusion, contenteditable/DOM sync handling).
- Key operational lesson: high-risk UI editing paths need stronger key strategy, error boundaries, and index semantics discipline.

### 2026-02-09
- Project-wide modularization review identified large monoliths and boundary coupling risks in service, IPC, and data layers.
- Recommendation pattern established: incremental extraction via facades and typed contracts.

### 2026-02-10
- Formal remediation plan defined for correctness, type boundary tightening, IPC decomposition, and reliability improvements.
- Emphasis on turning findings into executable gates and test-backed fixes.

### 2026-02-11
- Pre-feature gate milestone completed.
- Hard gates established and verified for pagination baseline, contract unification, job model alignment, feedback layer consistency, architecture guardrails, and gate automation.
- Project moved into Feature-First phase with controlled governance.

### 2026-02-23
- Multi-phase refactor wave completed with compatibility-first approach.
- Documentation system itself was simplified into a single-entry, low-drift model.

## Key Lessons (Durable)
1. Monolithic modules should be split behind compatibility facades first, then iteratively deepened.
2. Contract-first boundaries prevent cross-layer drift and reduce runtime surprises.
3. Long-running workflows must have unified progress and failure semantics.
4. Gate automation should encode architecture/process decisions, not only style rules.
5. Contenteditable-heavy UI requires explicit safeguards for DOM synchronization.

## Retired or Superseded Decisions
1. Multi-entry doc onboarding strategy is retired; single deterministic start doc is now used.
2. Distributed live-status reporting across multiple docs is retired; one live-status page is now used.
3. Archive-first operational reading is retired; archive content is consolidated here for lookup only.

## Historical Scope Covered
This consolidation replaces prior standalone archive narratives for:
- white-screen incident notes
- mistake notebook entries
- modularization review snapshots
- remediation plan details
- pre-feature gate records
- refactor progress snapshots

## How to Use Historical Context Safely
1. Validate historical statements against current code before acting.
2. Prefer active docs for any implementation decision.
3. Promote only durable lessons into active docs; keep incident detail here.
